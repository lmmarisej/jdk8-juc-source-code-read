/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
 * one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
 * using {@link lmmarise.util.concurrent.Executors} factory methods.
 *
 * <p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
 * provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
 * asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
 * and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
 * including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
 * Each {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} also maintains some basic
 * statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
 * 线程池解决了两个问题：当执行多个异步任务时，通过减少每个任务的执行开销，线程池会提供更好的性能，
 * 并且在执行一系列任务时，提供了绑定和管理资源的方法。
 * 每个ThreadPoolExecutor也维护了一些基础的数据统计，例如任务完成数量。
 *
 * <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 * provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
 * hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
 * {@link lmmarise.util.concurrent.Executors} factory methods {@link
 * lmmarise.util.concurrent.Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
 * automatic thread reclamation), {@link lmmarise.util.concurrent.Executors#newFixedThreadPool}
 * (fixed size thread pool) and {@link
 * lmmarise.util.concurrent.Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
 * preconfigure settings for the most common usage
 * scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
 * configuring and tuning this class:
 * 为了支持更广泛的上下文，ThreadPoolExecutor提供了许多可调节的参数和扩展性。
 * 使用线程池的工具类 Executors 可以根据需要构造不同类型的池：
 * newCachedThreadPool（无界线程池，线程自动回收）
 * newFixedThreadPool（确定大小的线程池）
 * newSingleThreadExecutor（只有一个线程的池）
 *
 * <dl>
 *
 * <dt>Core and maximum pool sizes</dt>
 * 核心和最大池大小
 *
 * <dd>A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} will automatically adjust the
 * pool size (see {@link #getPoolSize})
 * according to the bounds set by
 * corePoolSize (see {@link #getCorePoolSize}) and
 * maximumPoolSize (see {@link #getMaximumPoolSize}).
 * ThreadPoolExecutor可以根据池界限自动调节核心池和最大池大小
 *
 * When a new task is submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)},
 * and fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
 * created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
 * idle.  If there are more than corePoolSize but less than
 * maximumPoolSize threads running, a new thread will be created only
 * if the queue is full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize
 * the same, you create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting
 * maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded value such as {@code
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary
 * number of concurrent tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool
 * sizes are set only upon construction, but they may also be changed
 * dynamically using {@link #setCorePoolSize} and {@link
 * #setMaximumPoolSize}. </dd>
 * 当一个新任务被提交到池中，如果当前运行线程小于核心线程数，即使当前有空闲线程，
 * 也会新建一个线程来处理新提交的任务。如果当前运行线程数大于核心线程数并小于最大线程数，
 * 只有当等待队列已满的情况下才会新建线程。
 *
 * <dt>On-demand construction</dt>
 *
 * <dd>By default, even core threads are initially created and
 * started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
 * dynamically using method {@link #prestartCoreThread} or {@link
 * #prestartAllCoreThreads}.  You probably want to prestart threads if
 * you construct the pool with a non-empty queue. </dd>
 * 默认情况下，即使核心线程数已经被初始化，线程也只会在新任务到达时才会启动，
 * 但可以通过prestartCoreThread方法动态修改这个策略。
 * 如果构造池时传入了一个非空等待队列，可以通过prestartCoreThread预先启动线程。
 *
 * <dt>Creating new threads</dt>
 *
 * <dd>New threads are created using a {@link lmmarise.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory}.  If not
 * otherwise specified, a {@link lmmarise.util.concurrent.Executors#defaultThreadFactory} is
 * used, that creates threads to all be in the same {@link
 * ThreadGroup} and with the same {@code NORM_PRIORITY} priority and
 * non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
 * alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
 * etc. If a {@code ThreadFactory} fails to create a thread when asked
 * by returning null from {@code newThread}, the executor will
 * continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
 * should possess the "modifyThread" {@code RuntimePermission}. If
 * worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
 * permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
 * take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
 * state in which termination is possible but not completed.</dd>
 * 线程池通过ThreadFactory创建新的线程。默认使用Executors.defaultThreadFactory作为线程工厂。
 * 通过自定义不同的 ThreadFactory，我们可以指定线程名，线程组，优先级，守护线程状态等。
 * 如果ThreadFactory创建线程失败，线程池会继续运行，但是可能不会继续执行任务。
 * 如果工作线程或其他线程使用了没有许可(RuntimePermission)的线程池，服务可能会被降级：
 * 修改配置可能不会及时生效，并且在关闭池(shutdown)之后可能仍然处于一个不完全终止的状态。
 *
 * <dt>Keep-alive times</dt>
 *
 * <dd>If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
 * excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
 * than the keepAliveTime (see {@link #getKeepAliveTime(lmmarise.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)}).
 * This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the
 * pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active
 * later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be
 * changed dynamically using method {@link #setKeepAliveTime(long,
 * lmmarise.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)}.  Using a value of {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link
 * lmmarise.util.concurrent.TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively disables idle threads from ever
 * terminating prior to shut down. By default, the keep-alive policy
 * applies only when there are more than corePoolSize threads. But
 * method {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)} can be used to
 * apply this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
 * keepAliveTime value is non-zero. </dd>
 * 如果当前线程数多于核心线程，如果线程空闲时间超出 keepAliveTime，过量的线程将被销毁。
 * 这提供了一种减少资源占用的机制。keepAliveTime也可以通过setKeepAliveTime来动态的修改。
 * 默认情况下，保活策略只有对大于核心线程数的线程时候才会适用。
 * 通过allowCoreThreadTimeOut也可以为核心线程设置保活策略。
 *
 *
 * <dt>Queuing</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Any {@link lmmarise.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} may be used to transfer and hold
 * submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
 * 任何阻塞队列都可以用来转移或保存提交的任务，线程池大小和阻塞队列互相影响：
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers adding a new thread
 * rather than queuing.</li>
 * 如果运行线程数小于corePoolSize，提交新任务时就会新建一个线程来运行。
 *
 * <li> If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
 * thread.</li>
 * 如果运行线程数大于或等于corePoolSize，新提交的任务就会入列等待。
 *
 * <li> If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
 * this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
 * rejected.</li>
 * 如果队列已满，并且运行线程数小于最大线程数(maximumPoolSize)，也将会新建一个线程来运行；
 * 如果线程数大于maximumPoolSize，新提交的任务将会根据拒绝策略来处理。
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are three general strategies for queuing:
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> <em> Direct handoffs.</em> A good default choice for a work
 * queue is a {@link SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads
 * without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
 * will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
 * new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
 * handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
 * Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
 * avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
 * possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
 * arrive on average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 * 直接传递：通过SynchronousQueue直接把任务传递给线程。如果当前没可用线程，尝试入队操作会失败，
 * 然后再创建一个新的线程。当处理可能具有内部依赖性的请求时，该策略会避免请求被锁定。
 * 直接传递通常需要无界的最大线程数，避免拒绝新提交的任务。
 * 反过来，当任务持续到达的平均速度超过可处理的速度时，就可能导致线程的无限增长。
 *
 *
 * <li><em> Unbounded queues.</em> Using an unbounded queue (for
 * example a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined
 * capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
 * corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
 * threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
 * therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
 * each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
 * affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
 * While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
 * transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
 * unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
 * average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 * 无界队列：使用无界队列（如LinkedBlockingQueue）作为等待队列，当所有的核心线程都在处理任务时，
 * 新提交的任务都会进入队列等待。因此，不会有大于corePoolSize的线程会被创建（maximumPoolSize也将失去作用）。
 * 这种策略适合每个任务都完全独立于其他任务的情况；例如网站服务器。
 * 这种类型的等待队列可以使瞬间爆发的高频请求变得平滑。
 * 当任务持续到达的平均速度超过可处理速度时，可能导致等待队列无限增长。
 *
 * <li><em>Bounded queues.</em> A bounded queue (for example, an
 * {@link ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
 * used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
 * tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
 * off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
 * CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
 * lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
 * example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
 * time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
 * generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
 * may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 * decreases throughput.  </li>
 * 有界队列：当使用有限的最大线程数时，有界队列（如ArrayBlockingQueue）可以防止资源耗尽，但是难以调整和控制。
 * 队列大小和最大线程数可以相互作用：使用大的队列和小的线程数可以减少CPU使用率、系统资源和上下文切换的开销，
 * 但是会导致吞吐量变低，如果任务频繁地阻塞（例如被I/O限制），系统能为更多的线程调度执行时间。
 * 使用小的队列通常需要更多的线程数，这样可以最大化CPU使用率，但可能会需要更大的调度开销，从而降低吞吐量。
 *
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Rejected tasks</dt>
 * 拒绝策略
 *
 * <dd>New tasks submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)} will be
 * <em>rejected</em> when the Executor has been shut down, and also when
 * the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and work queue
 * capacity, and is saturated.  In either case, the {@code execute} method
 * invokes the {@link
 * lmmarise.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)}
 * method of its {@link lmmarise.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler}.  Four predefined handler
 * policies are provided:
 *
 * <ol>
 * 当线程池已经关闭或达到饱和（最大线程和队列都已满）状态时，新提交的任务将会被拒绝。
 * ThreadPoolExecutor 定义了四种拒绝策略：
 *
 *
 * <li> In the default {@link AbortPolicy}, the
 * handler throws a runtime {@link lmmarise.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException} upon
 * rejection. </li>
 * AbortPolicy：默认策略，在需要拒绝任务时抛出RejectedExecutionException
 *
 * <li> In {@link CallerRunsPolicy}, the thread
 * that invokes {@code execute} itself runs the task. This provides a
 * simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
 * new tasks are submitted. </li>
 * CallerRunsPolicy：直接在execute方法的调用线程中运行被拒绝的任务，如果线程池已经关闭，任务将被丢弃。
 *
 * <li> In {@link DiscardPolicy}, a task that
 * cannot be executed is simply dropped.  </li>
 * DiscardPolicy：直接丢弃任务
 *
 * <li>In {@link DiscardOldestPolicy}, if the
 * executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
 * is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
 * causing this to be repeated.) </li>
 * DiscardOldestPolicy：丢弃队列中等待时间最长的任务，并执行当前提交的任务，如果线程池已经关闭，任务将被丢弃。
 * </ol>
 *
 * It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link
 * lmmarise.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
 * especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
 * capacity or queuing policies. </dd>
 * 我们也可以自定义拒绝策略，只需要实现RejectedExecutionHandler就可以；
 * 需要注意的是，拒绝策略的运行需要指定线程池和队列的容量。
 *
 * <dt>Hook methods</dt>
 * 钩子方法
 *
 * <dd>This class provides {@code protected} overridable
 * {@link #beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)} and
 * {@link #afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)} methods that are called
 * before and after execution of each task.  These can be used to
 * manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
 * ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries.
 * Additionally, method {@link #terminated} can be overridden to perform
 * any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
 * fully terminated.
 * ThreadPoolExecutor 提供了可覆盖的方法：beforeExecute和afterExecute，分别在每个任务调用之前和之后执行。
 * 这些可以用来操作执行环境，例如，重新初始化ThreadLocal、数据收集统计、日志添加等。
 * 此外，terminated 方法也可以被重写，在线程池被销毁之后处理指定逻辑。
 *
 * <p>If hook or callback methods throw exceptions, internal worker
 * threads may in turn fail and abruptly terminate.</dd>
 * 如果钩子方法或回调方法抛出异常，内部工作线程也会失败并销毁。
 *
 * <dt>Queue maintenance</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Method {@link #getQueue()} allows access to the work queue
 * for purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of this method for
 * any other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two supplied methods,
 * {@link #remove(Runnable)} and {@link #purge} are available to
 * assist in storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks
 * become cancelled.</dd>
 * getQueue方法允许访问工作队列，以便进行监视和调试。不推荐通过此方法达到其他目的。
 * 当队列任务被取消时，可以通过remove 和 purge方法帮助回收存储空间。
 *
 * <dt>Finalization</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A pool that is no longer referenced in a program <em>AND</em>
 * has no remaining threads will be {@code shutdown} automatically. If
 * you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even
 * if users forget to call {@link #shutdown}, then you must arrange
 * that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate
 * keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
 * setting {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.  </dd>
 * 如果线程池在程序中不再被引用，并且池内已经没有线程，此时线程池会自动关闭。
 * 通过设置allowCoreThreadTimeOut可以确保及时忘记手动shutdown，池也会自动关闭。
 *
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p><b>Extension example</b>. Most extensions of this class
 * override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
 * here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
 *   private boolean isPaused;
 *   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();
 *
 *   public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }
 *
 *   protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
 *     super.beforeExecute(t, r);
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *       t.interrupt();
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void pause() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       isPaused = true;
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void resume() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       isPaused = false;
 *       unpaused.signalAll();
 *     } finally {

public class ThreadPoolExecutor extends AbstractExecutorService {
    /**
     * The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
     * two conceptual fields
     *   workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
     *   runState,    indicating whether running, shutting down etc
     * ThreadPoolExecutor 通过一个int型参数 ctl 来控制池状态，封装了两个概念字段：
     *   workerCount：表示有效线程数
     *   runState：表示池运行状态，正在运行、关闭等。
     *
     *
     * In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
     * (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
     * billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
     * the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
     * and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
     * arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.
     * 为了把这些状态封装为一个int字段，我们限制workerCount最大为(2^29)-1。
     * 未来如果有必要，可以改为AtomicLong，并对标志位也做出相应调整。
     * 目前来说，使用int会提高程序运行速度，并且代码也相对简单。
     *
     * The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
     * permitted to start and not permitted to stop.  The value may be
     * transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
     * for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
     * asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
     * bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
     * reported as the current size of the workers set.
     * workerCount标识了工作线程数。这个值只能代表活跃线程的瞬时状态，
     * 例如ThreadFactory 创建线程失败，或者在池终止时依然存在正在执行的线程。
     * 用户可见的池大小被记录为当前工作集的大小。
     *
     * The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
     * runState 提供了对池生命周期的控制，包括以下几种状态：
     *
     *   RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
     *   SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
     *   STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
     *             and interrupt in-progress tasks
     *   TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
     *             the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
     *             will run the terminated() hook method
     *   TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
     *   RUNNING：可以接收新的任务和队列任务
     *   SHUTDOWN：不接收新的任务，但是会运行队列任务
     *   STOP：不接收新任务，也不会运行队列任务，并且中断正在运行的任务
     *   TIDYING：所有任务都已经终止，workerCount为0，当池状态为TIDYING时将会运行terminated()方法
     *   TERMINATED：terminated 完成执行。
     *
     *
     * The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
     * ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
     * time, but need not hit each state. The transitions are:
     *
     * RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
     *    On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize()
     * (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
     *    On invocation of shutdownNow()
     * SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
     *    When both queue and pool are empty
     * STOP -> TIDYING
     *    When pool is empty
     * TIDYING -> TERMINATED
     *    When the terminated() hook method has completed
     *
     * Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
     * state reaches TERMINATED.
     * 当池状态变为TERMINATED，在awaitTermination方法中等待的线程将会返回。
     *
     * Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
     * straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become
     * empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
     * we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
     * that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see
     * below).

     * 工作线程运行主方法。循环从队列中获取任务并执行。
     *
     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     * 如果工作线程的
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
